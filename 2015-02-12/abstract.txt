Title: Object Algebras in Our Language

Venue: CB 313

Abstract:

This is like a tutorial implementation of object algebras in our
language. Currently our compiler has no support for simple syntax of
object algebras, so we have to design types by ourselves using simple
constructors. In this talk, I'll show you how to implement algebra
interfaces, queries and transformations, and how it works while still
holding extensibility by using intersection types. An advanced feature
is to have visitors for data structures, so as to save a lot of work
in client code. Some more complicated examples will be available then,
together with some discussions on pros and cons of programming in such
a style, and prospects of designing syntactic sugar for algebras.
