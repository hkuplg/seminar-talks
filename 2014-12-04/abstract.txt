Abstract:

Some new features are introduced in Java 8, of which lambda
expressions play an important role. While we are writing pure OO-style
programs, the lambda syntax and functional interfaces provide a more
concise way, just like those in functional languages. Lambda
expressions, as anonymous objects, as return values, can be placed
everywhere. As the first part of the talk, the introduction to lambdas
is primary yet necessary before we discuss transformation algebras in
this style of Java.

After that, as an extension of my last talk, "Object algebras with
Java annotations", we will focus mainly on transformation algebras of
two types, namely non-contextual and contextual, implemented with
different approaches. To make it easier to understand, some examples
will be available during discussion.
