Abstract:

Property-based testing is the state-of-the-art testing technology
provided by many programming languages. Without specifying particular
test data, tests are in the form of assertions about logical
properties that a function should meet. Then the test tool will
generates random test data to falsify these assertions at
runtime. This technology is originated in QuickCheck, a combinator
library written in Haskell. In the first half of this talk, we will
give a brief introduction to QuickCheck, including how to write
properties and data generators. In the second half, we will discuss
its advantages and disadvantages and the latest development of
property-based testing in Haskell.
