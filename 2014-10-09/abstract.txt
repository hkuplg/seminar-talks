Abstract:

A nice solution to the "Expression Problem" can meet the requirements
in programming languages, including the extensibility in both adding
new data types and new operations without modifying the existing code,
holding type safety and so on. A novel solution, based on object
algebras, was proposed in Bruno's paper (ECOOP 2012) showing its
advantages as well as the implementation in various programming
languages. Although existing languages are not sufficient to deal with
object algebras specifically, it could be easily implemented in
functional languages like Haskell with its type classes. Whereas in
Java, a lot of interfaces and inheritance are required.

Our research recently focuses on the implementation of object algebras
in Java in a specific way. It allows to generate the "ugly" code for
interfaces automatically by annotations in Java reflection. Currently
we have queries and transformations based on the traversal by monoids
and the visitor pattern. We will see how it works to deal with the
algebras as well as the combinations, and how it saves a lot of work
from the users.
