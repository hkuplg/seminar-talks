Title: FCore: Secrets of the backend compiler

Speaker: Tomas

Data & Time: Thursday,20 November, 2014 2:00 pm

Venue: CB 313

Abstract:

Last week, we submitted a paper about the representation of functions
and optimizations used in our compiler backed. It forced us to
motivate and explain it in (hopefully) a clear way with examples and
corrected formalization, evaluate it in experiments and relate it to
other people’s work.

So, this week’s seminar will be about that. In other words, I will
repeat some things about the backend from my first seminar, but if you
struggled to understand it back then or forgot it, this seminar will
hopefully clear out any remaining confusion.  I will also discuss some
future work plans which will connect with this week’s compiler
meeting.
