Abstract:

At the core of F2J is a language known as System FI, which is just a
light-weight extension of System F. Simple as it seems, the type
system is enough for employing various extensible designs that are
sometimes clumsy to use even in those existing languages with a
sophisticated type system. For example, it is able to solve the
limitations of using object algebras in Java and Scala. Moreover, the
type system allows even improvements on those designs. In this talk, I
will show you what F2J has provided us in terms of the ease of
programming.
