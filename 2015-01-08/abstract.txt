Abstract:

As the title says, this talk is an extension of my last seminar talk,
"The Expression Problem". In the last talk, we identified two problems
of the naive solution, namely, (1) the name problem (2) the casting
problem. Using Java’s support for covariant return types, we have
solved problem (2). In this talk, we will be exploring how to solve
problem (1) using nested components. Then based on this solution, we
will go deeper about family polymorphism and more extensibility this
solution gives. We will also briefly discuss a set of sub-problems
that go beyond Wadler’s original Expression Problem.
