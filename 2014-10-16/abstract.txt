Title: SPLASH 2014 Info and Practice Talks

Speaker: Tomas

Data & Time: Thursday,16 October, 2014 2:00 pm

Venue: CB 313

Abstract:

Tomas is going to a conference soon, so the order was a bit
shuffled. This seminar will have three parts: 1) General information
about the conference, the most famous speakers, top 5 papers (we may
discuss some of them at later seminars), and other highlights. 2)
Practice Talk 1: A two-minute overview stating the most critical
issues of the research (the “elevator talk”) + your feedback, 3)
Practice Talk 2: A separate (strictly-timed) 40-minute description of
the proposer’s research. This will be broken down into at most 25
minutes of presentation and 15 minutes of questions + your feedback.

This is the abstract for the practice talks: Traditional programming
language namespaces evolved from filesystem structures. We describe
different scenarios where this rigid code organization becomes a
limiting factor. After that, we propose a more flexible code
organization using tags. We then illustrate it on Python, including
how we can convert existing code structures to the new tag-based
one. Finally, we discuss our plans how to extend this work to
statically typed languages in the future.
