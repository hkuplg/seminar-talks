Title: What makes our compiler fast

Speaker: Jeremy

Venue: CB 313

Abstract:

In this talk, we will have a close look at one of the optimization
techniques in our compiler, namely apply-opt.

First we will see the motivation behind apply-opt, and why it is
essential (and challenging) to make a practical compiler. Also we will
look at the original non-solution that we adopted before and explain
why it doesn't work for some programs. Then I will introduce a
runtime-check solution that perfectly solves part of the problem while
incurring a little bit overhead. In the later part of the talk, I will
propose anther potential solution that deals with the other part of
the problem (which is about overriding fields), and have a discussion
with the audience about other possible solutions. Finally, I will
conclude with our contributions and briefly talk about other related
work.
