Speaker: Weixin

Venue: CB 313

Abstract:

Symbolic execution is a program analysis technique which uses symbolic
values rather than concrete values as program inputs. With symbolic
values, all possible execution path of the program will be explored
with all possible results expressed by symbolic values. Based on it,
we can have better understanding of the program behaviour.

In this talk, I will give an introduction about symbolic execution and
SMT solver. Then, I will demonstrate these ideas using the symbolic
evaluator implemented for our compiler.
